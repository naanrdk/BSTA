# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency Application

This Python code provides a framework for interacting with a blockchain to record and track shipment details for supply chain transparency. It includes placeholder classes and methods that need to be replaced with actual implementations specific to your chosen blockchain platform.

## Prerequisites

To use this application, you need:

- Python installed on your system.
- Access to a blockchain platform or API for transaction creation and retrieval.

## Installation

No installation steps are required for this code. However, you need to replace the placeholder `BlockchainClient` class with an actual library or implementation that interacts with your chosen blockchain platform.

## Usage

1. Replace the placeholder `BlockchainClient` class with an actual implementation that interacts with your chosen blockchain platform.

2. Run the `main()` function to simulate recording and tracking shipments on the blockchain.

```bash
python bsta.py
